Difficulty: Medium

https://leetcode.com/problems/flatten-2d-vector/description/

Implement an iterator to flatten a 2d vector.

For example,
Given 2d vector =
```
[
  [1,2],
  [3],
  [4,5,6]
]
```
By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, the order of elements returned by next should be: [1,2,3,4,5,6].
