# 144. Binary Tree Preorder Traversal

Difficulty: Medium

https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-preorder-traversal/description/

Given a binary tree, return the preorder traversal of its nodes' values.

For example:  
Given binary tree {1,#,2,3},
```
   1
    \
     2
    /
   3
```
return [1,2,3].

**Note:** Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?
