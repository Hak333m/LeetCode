# 429. N-ary Tree Level Order Traversal

Difficulty: Easy

https://leetcode.com/problems/n-ary-tree-level-order-traversal/description/

Given an n-ary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, level by level).

For example, given a 3-ary tree:

We should return its level order traversal:
```
[
     [1],
     [3,2,4],
     [5,6]
]
``` 

Note:

The depth of the tree is at most 1000.
The total number of nodes is at most 5000.
